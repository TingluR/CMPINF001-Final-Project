    "### Introduction\n",
    "The project uses three different submetrics to measure and analyze the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We think the safety and the greenery area are the most important thing of live in a neighborhood, so the three submetrices we used are Arrest Rates, natural environment conditions and firearm seizures. We think those three metrics are having the same weight, which means the three metrics are the same important. After each of us got best neighborhood in the each of metric, we combined those data set together and get the best neighborhood from those three submatrices.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### My metric\n",
    "Our metric is the arrest rate, firearm seizure and greenery area rate at each unit area for each neighborhood. We used three datasets: Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data, Firearm Seizures Data and Pittsburgh neighborhood natural environment conditions.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The best neighborhood\n",
    "After apply my metric, the best neighborhood we came up with is Regent Square. It only has 2 arrest count between these years therefore based on my metric, it is the safest place to live in. I also came up with a visualization bar graph that shows a low arrest rate, a low firearm seizure rate and a high natural environment cover rate compared to other neighborhood.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Tinglu: My personal favorite neighborhood is oakland since I live here and it is where our college at. However, we always receive crime alerts so it is actually not as safe as I hope. By collecting data, merging data and anaylizing data, I came up with the neighborhood with the lowest arrest count. Therefore based on my metric, Mt. Oliver Neighborhood is the best neighborhood.</li>\n",
    "    <li>JOJO: I use the Firearm Seizures Dataset. my measure is that the lowest total number of firearm seizures in a neighborhood between 2015 and 2022 means that the smaller this safety hazard is, the greater it is anyway.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Xinge: My result is that Regent Square have largest total greenery area according to the data(in percentage of the neighborhood's land area), so Regent Square is the neighborhoods have best natural environment conditions, and it is the best neighborhood in my data metrix. Compare to my best neighborhood, which is Squirrel Hill, Regent Square is located in the suburbs, which have advantage in greenery area, Squirrel Hill is located at urban area and don't have advantage on greenery area.</li>\n",

The first step we have to do is make all three indexes of Swisshelm Park to 1, which means we have to devide the same number of each column's number to that column. After the weight of three indexes are same, we can just easily calculate the best neighborhood by add the incidents rate and firearm seizures rate together and subtract by the total green area, because the first two indexes are the lower the better, and total green area is the higher the better, and we can sort the result and the smallest number represented the best neighborhood our group got as the result."
